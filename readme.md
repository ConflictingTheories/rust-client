# Rust Client Example

This repo is for exploring rust and learning more about it. 

It is based around a client-server model. The client will aim to be WASM compatible to allow for a web deployment.

The Server will aim to be an API router for handling server calls (REST + Websocket) and possibly some WebRTC stuff for video/audio

Additionally will try to act a simple boilerplate for spinning up quick apps.

The GUI is using the awesome [Egui Library](https://github.com/emilk/egui) which is being used for the graphical ui components within the client.
